Enhance JUnit tests using AI-assisted generation

Expanded the unit tests for the Amos application by leveraging AI assistance.
Additional test cases cover edge cases and error handling scenarios that were
previously untested, improving code reliability and ensuring better validation
of parser methods and task list operations.

Let's use AI to generate thorough test coverage for parsing, task addition,
deletion, and index validation. This helps catch potential bugs earlier and
makes the codebase more robust without changing existing functionality.
